*Markdown Here* is a Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Thunderbird extension that lets you write email<sup>&dagger;</sup> in Markdown<sup>&Dagger;</sup> and render them before sending. It also supports syntax highlighting (just specify the language in a fenced code block).

Writing email with code in it is pretty tedious. Writing Markdown with code in it is easy. I found myself writing email in Markdown in the Github in-browser editor, then copying the preview into email. This is a pretty absurd workflow, so I decided create a tool to write and render Markdown right in the email.

To discover what can be done with Markdown in *Markdown Here*, check out the [Markdown Here Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) and the other [wiki pages](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki).

<sup>&Dagger;: And TeX mathematical formulae!</sup>
