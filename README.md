### PENTIVE-Capstone

>[!NOTE]
>Ethical Hacking lab utilizing Docker Compose 


# Objectives

1. **Create a learning environment that is easily accessible and encourages active participation.**
   - Establish a Docker container platform that comes with pre-installed penetration testing tools.
   - Implement the necessary infrastructure on the college servers to enable classroom access.
   - Create comprehensive documentation to facilitate the onboarding process for both instructors and students.

2. **Emulate real-world methods of attack.**
   - Securely Configure system images with known vulnerabilities, such as Metasploitable and Juice Shop.
   - Offer familiarity with contemporary hacking toolkits such as Kali Linux.
   - Allow for the implementation of conventional exploit techniques without actual danger.

3. **Encourage responsible usage through vigilant monitoring.**
   - Create activity audit trails to track student actions.
   - Deploy usage analytics dashboards.
   - Implement ethical conduct as an inherent part of the design process.

4. **Design a lab that is adaptable and capable of being expanded.**
   - Utilize Docker's composability to create reusable components for laboratory purposes.
   - Create standardized laboratory templates to facilitate quick rebuilding.
   - Organize the environment for future expansion through Kubernetes orchestration.

5. **Creation of a simulated ethical hacking environment.**
   - Create a Docker-based virtual network that offers a realistic and controlled environment for ethical hacking exercises.
   - Verify that the environment is capable of scaling and reproducing diverse network configurations and security scenarios.

6. **Offering practical cybersecurity training.**
   - Create comprehensive training modules and scenarios that encompass a wide array of cybersecurity threats and corresponding defensive measures.
   - Integrate contemporary cybersecurity tools and techniques into the curriculum to offer cutting-edge training experiences.

7. **Develop and deploy a system that is both secure and capable of being reset.**
   - Implement a system that enables the environment to be effortlessly restored to a predetermined secure state, guaranteeing uninterrupted availability for practice and experimentation.
   - Implement an automated deployment and rollback process to reduce the amount of time the system is not available and ensure a reliable learning platform.

8. **Ensuring easy access and efficient allocation of resources.**
   - Implement the deployment of the Docker container on university servers to guarantee accessibility for both students and faculty.
   - Supervise and control the utilization of resources to deliver a smooth and uninterrupted learning experience, even during periods of high concurrent usage.
